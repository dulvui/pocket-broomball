AntiFeature: Not all assets of this game are free
The team logos were sent to me directly by the teams themselves, granting me authorization to use them. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that no explicit license has been issued for these logos, and at the time of creating the game, I was unaware of the implications of not inquiring about their licensing status. As a result, all rights to the logos belong to the respective teams.
If you want to use these logos, please contact me or the teams directly.
